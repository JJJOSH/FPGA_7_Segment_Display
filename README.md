# Seven Segment Display using FPGA and Verilog HDL
A seven-segment that displays a representation of numbers entered by the userâ€™s input have been design and tested. Functional validations of the buttons input resulting to the display of numbers (1, 2, etc) were also tested. Each display consists of seven segments of liquid crystals on the MAX 10 board. These segments have two states: on and off. 

# Things needed 
1. ****MAX 10 FPGA Board****
2. ****Quartus Prime****
3. ****USB Cable****
4. ****Seven Segment Display****: This comes with the MAX 10 board choosen for the is project.

# Steps in implementing the design
1. Design and write the verilog code
2. Pin Assignement using the Pin planner in Quartus Prime Software
3. Programme the MAX 10 Board using the programmer in Quartus Prime Software
