# Seven Segment Display Decoder In FPGA using Verilog
A seven-segment that displays a representation of numbers entered by the userâ€™s input have been design and tested. Functional validations of the buttons input resulting to the display of numbers (1, 2, etc) were also tested. Each display consists of seven segments of liquid crystals on the MAX 10 board. These segments have two states: on and off.
